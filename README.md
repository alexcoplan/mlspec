# MLSpec

is a lightweight testing library for Standard ML, inspired by [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).

## Usage

MLSpec has only been tested thus far with [Poly/ML](http://www.polyml.org). To use the library, you should call the `PolyML.make` function, like so:

```sml
PolyML.make "mlspec/src";
```

MLSpec makes use of anonymous functions to act as an analogue of Ruby blocks. This provides a convenient way to write specification-based tests, using a similar style to tests that one would write using RSpec.

The most convenient way to write tests using MLSpec is best seen by example. Suppose we are testing a function, `add`, which simply adds two integers:

```sml
fun add x y = x + y;

let open MLSpec
in
	test (fn (describe) =>
		describe "add" (fn (it) => 
			it "should say that 2 + 2 is 4" [ expect (add 2 2) (toBeTheInteger 4) ]
		)
	)
end;
```

Tests in MLSpec are structured in three levels. At the outermost level, a testing "block" (a term that will now be used synonymously with anonymous function) is defined, as an argument to the `MLSpec.test` function. It takes a parameter, the name of which is given by the user, but is conventionally `describe`. This argument may then be called (any number of times) with a string and another block as arguments, to form a "describe block". In a describe block, the user (writing the tests) may specify the expected behaviour for a given component of the software in question, such as a function or structure. The first argument to the describe function is a string, detailing the component that the describe block specifies (often just the name of said component). The second is a block that forms the describe block itself, taking an argument which is conventionally named "it".

The reason behind these parameters and their naming conventions is the pseudo-natural-language specification syntax which may be achieved as a result. It is natural to describe a given component by listing the things it should do, for example. Structuring the specification in this way also enables informative and easily-understood feedback in the event that a test fails.

Returning to our syntactic description; within each describe block, a series of calls to the block parameter (conventionally named `it`) are made, detailing the various things that the component should do (or properties which it should possess). The `it` function takes a string (see the example above), and a list of calls to the `expect` and `doNotExpect` fucntions (assertions). The `expect` function takes two (curried) parameters. The first is the "actual", or "obtained" value (normally obtained by a call to or involving the component that is being specified). The second is an expectation. Expectations match properties of values. They are defined in the file `MLSExpectations.sml` and documented below.

The above is perhaps better understood with an example. To that end, an example test suite is given in `example.sml`.

## Expectations

Expectations are matchers within MLSpec tests. They match some "expected" property against "actual" data. Examples are `toBeTrue`, `toThrowAnException`, and `toBeTheInteger 6`.

Expectations are asserted by means of the functions `expect` and `doNotExpect`. These constructs form specifications that are highly readable. Two simple examples of assertions using boolean expectations are `expect true toBeTrue`, or `doNotExpect true toBeFalse`. Many more examples are available in `example.sml`.

The following expectations are currently available:

__Equivalence Expectations__

 - `toBe (value)` : is a polymorphic equality matcher. This is useful to test equality (in a quick and dirty manner). However, use of this function is generally not advisable, since it cannot provide useful error messages due to ML's lack of supportÂ for polymorphic printing.
 - `toBeTrue` : asserts the truth of a boolean value.
 - `toBeFalse` : asserts the falsehood of a boolean value.
 - `toBeTheInteger i` : asserts equality with the integer i, providing a clear failure message, giving the expected and actual values.
 - All other equality expectations (defined in `MLSExpectations.sml`) have the same semantics as `toBeTheInteger i` for their respective types: examples are `toBeTheString s`, `toBeTheIntegerList l`, `toBeTheBooleanListList`, `toBeTheStringPair`.

__Exception Expectations__
 - `toRaiseAnException` : asserts that a function of type `unit -> 'a` raises an exception.
 - `toRaiseTheException e` : asserts that a function of type `unit -> 'a` raises the exception `e`.

__Other Expectations__
 - `toMatchThePredicate p` : asserts that the given value satisfies the predicate p. Again, this is polymorphic and therefore cannot give helpful error messages. A better alternative to this function may well be one of the predicate functions from the `MLSpec.Constructors` structure (see the next section).

_Note: Contributions to expectations (especially equality matchers) are very welcome._

Expectations are provided for most common combinations of built-in types. However, you will at some point undoubtedly need to define your own. For example, suppose you are testing a custom datatype such as a queue. The next section explains the `Constructors` API, which provdies a simple interface to create your own expectations.

## Custom Expectations

The `MLSpec.Constructors` structure provides functions for creating custom expectations. They are documented and defined in `MLSExpectations.sml`. `trees.sml` provides a detailed example of typical use of these functions.

## Configuration

`MLSpec.Config` provdies configuration, which is documented at its definition (in `MLSpec.sml`) and mainly useful for configuring MLSpec to work as part of an automated workflow, or behind an API.

MLSpec may be configured to write test results to a file instead of the console by calling `MLSpec.Config.writeToFile "file_name.txt";`. This writes the results in the format `e,p,f`, where `e` is the number of errors, `p` is the number of passes and `f` is the number of failures. Calling `MLSpec.Config.includeBreakdown ()` will include the normal breakdown that MLSpec would output to the console in the file.
